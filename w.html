text: The following project is the end result of a UX class I took a couple of weeks ago. Since the school is above Westfield mall, the professor asked us to solve the problem of making mall customers spend more money.<br><br>We went downstairs and talked with a couple of people and mostly observed behavior patterns. My conclusion was that most of the time people already have something in mind they are shopping for. They have brand preferences, they are shopping for themselves or for somebody else and they have a hard time locating stores in the mall. They don't realize that the mall already has an app that has a location feature.<br><br>With these things in mind, I decided to create an iOS app experience that gives a personalized and relevant shopping experience that leads to sales. I decided to use Facebookâ€˜s API to generate data about items they shared or liked, from brands they and other friends follow. I also decided to use iBeacon technology to help with discovery of the app.<br><br>One of the challenges I faced was to keep it simple. When I first started I had a bunch of features and interactions in mind and realized this was adding extra complexity. At the end I cut quite a few features to keep things simple.
