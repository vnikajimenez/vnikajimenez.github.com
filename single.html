text: <p><a href="http://singlelist.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a></p><br><p>I wanted to solve the problem of having a simple disposable list.<p><br><p>I started by going through a bunch of other task list productivity apps. Then I sketched out a simple user flow, and some wireframes. I ended up jumping right from wireframe into HTML and CSS to do the final visual design.</p><br><p>I really tried to keep this product as minimal as possible, while still prompting the user through the actions.</p><br><p>The product is now live but still has some issues when text is too long. I also never quite got the interaction feeling right for checking off the items from your phone. I tested it with a couple of friends and found a couple of people tried copying lists off of recipe websites and trying to paste it right into the input box.</p><br><p>This would be another challenge we'd need to figure out to really make this product production ready.</p>
