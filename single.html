text: <p>Single is an application for sending a shopping list to your smartphone. I wanted a lightweight way to create a list on my desktop and have it available from my phone while I was doing groceries. Unlike task management apps, I wanted this to feel like a disposable list, much like writing the list on a scrap of paper.<p><br><p>I started by going through a bunch of other task list productivity apps. Then I sketched out a simple user flows, and some wireframes. I ended up jumping right from wireframe into HTML and CSS to do the final visual design.</p><br><p>I really tried to keep this product as minimal as possible, while still prompting the user through the actions.</p><br><p>The product is now live but still has some issues when text is too long. I also never quite got the interaction feeling right for checking off the items from your phone. I tested it with a couple of friends and found a couple of people tried copying lists off of recipe websites and tried to paste them right into the input box. This would be a challenge we'd need to figure out to really make this product production ready.</p>
