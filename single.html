text: Sunday mornings I like going to the market and get ingredients for cooking my meals of the week. I would usually write an email or a note in my phone, I wanted something that I could send to anybody with a mobile browser like my mum's old Black Berry without going through the complications of downloading an app. This is the reason why I though about something more simple, a text message. It's work in progress and definetely needs more work on the interaction side and  on the edge user cases.<br><a href="http://singlelist.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a>
