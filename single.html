title: Single
text: I wanted to solve the problem of having a simple disposable list. I started by going through a bunch of other task list productivity apps. Then I sketched out a simple user flow, and some wireframes. I ended up jumping right from wireframe into HTML and CSS to do the final visual design.I really tried to keep this product as minimal as possible, while still prompting the user through the actions. The product is now live but still has some issues when text is too long. I also never quite got the interaction feeling right for checking off the items from your phone. I started asking friends to try the product in front of me and found a couple of people tried copying lists off of recipe websites and trying to paste it right into the input box. This would be another challenge we'd need to figure out to really make this product production ready.<br><a href="http://singlelist.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a>
