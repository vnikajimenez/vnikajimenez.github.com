title: Single
text: Sunday mornings I like going to the market to get ingredients for cooking my meals of the week. I would usually write an email to myself, or make a note in my phone. I wanted something that I could send to myself or someone else, without going through the complications of downloading an app. This is the reason why I thought about something more simple, a text message. It's work in progress and definetely needs more work on the interaction side and on the edge cases.<br><a href="http://singlelist.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a>
