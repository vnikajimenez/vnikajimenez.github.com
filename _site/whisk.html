        <p>CONCEPT:<br>My application helps a job seeker track, manage and get updated on the status of their application within a specific company. In this case we started with the customers of SmartRecruiters.<br>Job seeking is a stressful matter. For most of us, when we send an application to most companies, it is like entering a black hole where we don’t have any idea what is going to happen next. After the product manager on the team and I did some user research, we concluded that most of the time people feel anxious, frustrated and worried when looking for a job, and that they find the hiring process lengthy, unclear, and lacking in feedback.<br>With this in our minds, we defined our  project by this problem; I don’t have visibility into what happens with my job application after I’ve sent it.<br><br>SOLUTION:<br>After we got the requirements made by the PM, another designer and I started to work on the main touch points that the candidate would have to go through, and what kind of information is valuable from a user standpoint. After whiteboarding we concluded that if the candidate has to go through phone screening, an on­site interview before getting an offer, this process should be displayed in the form of a timeline where the candidate can view the status of the application, get updates, communicate with the hiring team, accept interviews and receive the offer letter. New updates will be displayed in the top of the page along with timestamps.<br>We also added a place where the user can view multiple applications with different companies, all displayed in a simple list view.<br><br>We also wanted to create a more personal experience, by customizing a company’s looks, adding the company’s logo and colors, and using friendly language.<br><br>TESTING IDEAS & FEEDBACK:<br>We finished the first version of wireframes and we tested a couple of hypothesis about the experience of being taken from the job success message into the application. We found that people understood their job status and understood how to communicate with the hiring team.<br><br>CHALLENGES:<br>One edge case that came up later, was how to handle to when a candidate had applied to multiple positions in a company.<br><br>When a candidate applies to two or more positions within a company, they can exchange messages with different hiring teams. I needed to ensure it was obvious what position messages you recieved belonged with.<br><br>Another challenge was to be clear that when you are applying to more than one position, you will be considered for the first before being considered for the next one, as this is the current way companies do it in SmartRecruiters.<br><br>OUTCOME<br> The following screens you see below. This application is currently under development and will be released in June.<br><a class="prototype"href="http://marvl.in/4abedc">My application FTUX prototype</a></p>
