      <h3>Concept:</h3><br><p>Last year, Google showcased Material Design for the first time. Material design guides you in creating interfaces that behave like objects in real life where light, movement and form gives better affordances and a very rich interaction experience. This is one of the main reasons why I decided to explore converting SmartRecruiters Hiring Android app into Material.</p><br><h3>Start:</h3><br><p>First I created a flow map of each screen along with what actions connected them to each other. This helped me to have a clear idea of the product from high level hierarchy to low level interactions.</p><br><h3>Candidate Page:</h3><br><p>I decided to design the Candidate page of our application first because it is SmartRecruiter's most used feature on mobile.</p><br><p>The existing design has an iOS feeling background and icons. I switched the background to a solid color from the current avatar colors we have in our style sheet. I made sure all icons matched the current Android guidelines.</p><br><p>The info icon interaction in the current design opened a drawer menu. I found this to feel too heavy for the small amount of information being accessed. Instead I used an overflow dialog to make the information more quickly accessible.</p><br><p>I also added the floating action button that transforms into a toolbar upon press or scroll. I added the share ability to the toolbar, which is part of our new HireLoop feature being added soon.</p><br><h3>Jobs Page:</h3><br><p>The first thing I did with this section was unify the header between the listing and details section into a seam. The original design felt inconsistent while navigating around. On the job details page, I felt the "Posted", "Sourcing", "Days Open" and "Spent" indicators looked tappable, which they are not, so I made sure to avoid that in the new design.</p><br><p>In the original design, clicking on the share icon at the top right brought you to a "Referrals" section of the product, where users can share the job url to other contacts on Facebook and LinkedIn. Going to the "Referrals" section often confused our users, as they felt they were being taken to a different app. Instead I displayed these share actions with the simple menu as I did on the candidate page. I also added the ability to share on Hireloop</p><br><h3>Hireloop / Home Page:</h3><br><p>In the Hireloop section of our app, I added a floating action button that brings up a new Hireloop post. I kept the same tab navigation as we had before because of the limited number of top-level views. I have the tab navigation scroll off-screen with the content and return when the user reverse scrolls.</p><br><p>I wanted to improve the layout of information within the Hireloop list, as I found the original design did not make it obvious that you could "comment" or "agree" on certain events. Now, it is more obvious if an event is actionable. Before drilling down into more detail on an event, you can see how many comments and agreements the event has.</p><br><p>Notifications and Job Approval's funcionality stayed the same but I updated their visual design to be consistent.</p><br><h3>Status:</h3><br><p>This is still a work in progress. It is currently being reviewed by the rest of our design team and then will be queued up to be worked on.</p>
