      I wanted to solve the problem of having a simple disposable list. <br>I started by going through a bunch of other task list productivity apps. Then I sketched out a simple user flow, and some wireframes. I ended up jumping right from wireframe into HTML and CSS to do the final visual design. <br>I really tried to keep this product as minimal as possible, while still prompting the user through the actions. <br>The product is now live but still has some issues when text is too long. I also never quite got the interaction feeling right for checking off the items from your phone. I tested it with a couple of friends and found a couple of people tried copying lists off of recipe websites and trying to paste it right into the input box.<br> This would be another challenge we'd need to figure out to really make this product production ready.<br><br><a href="http://singlelist.herokuapp.com/">Check it out!</a>
