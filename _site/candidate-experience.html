      <p><a href="http://marvl.in/86dba6" target="_blank">Candidate Exp part two</a></p><br><h3>CONCEPT</h3><br><p>Candidate Experience is a project I worked on at SmartRecruiters. SmartRecruiters helps companies hire good people. I worked with another designer on the initial UX and then was the only designer working on the UI and visual design. The "Candidate Experience" helps a job seeker track and manage their application after applying to a company.</p><br><p>Job seeking is stressful. When we send an application to most companies, it is as if we sent the application into a blackhole. We end up having no idea what is happening with our application. After the team's product manager and I did some user research, we concluded that while looking for a job, people often feel anxious, frustrated and worried. We also found that they felt the hiring process was lengthy, unclear, and lacking in feedback.</p><br><p>We decided to succinctly define the problem we wanted to solve as "I don’t have visibility into what happens with my job application after I’ve sent it".</p><br><h3>SOLUTION</h3><br><p>After receiving the requirements from the product manager, another designer and I started to work on the main touch points that the candidate would have to go through, and what kind of information is valuable to the user at each point. After whiteboarding we concluded that if the candidate has to go through multiple steps before getting an offer, this process should be displayed in the form of a timeline. The timeline would allow the user to see the status of their application, communicate with the hiring team, accept interviews and receive the offer letter. New updates are displayed at the top of the page along with timestamps.</p><br><p>We also ensured that if the user had multiple applications in with different companies, all of them were displayed in a simple list view.</p><br><p>We also wanted to create a more personal experience, by allowing the page to be customized to match the company’s looks. The company can add their logo and change colors.</p><br><h3>TESTING IDEAS &amp; FEEDBACK</h3><br><p>We finished the first version of wireframes and we tested a couple of hypothesis about the experience of being taken from the job success message into the application. We found that people understood their job status and understood how to communicate with the hiring team.</p><br><h3>CHALLENGES</h3><br><p>One edge case that came up, was how to handle to when a candidate had applied to multiple positions in a single company.</p><br><p>When a candidate applies to two or more positions within a company, they can exchange messages with different hiring teams. I needed to ensure it was obvious what position the messages you were sending and receiving actually belonged with.</p><br><h3>OUTCOME</h3><br><p>The screens you see to your left. This application is currently under development and will be released in July.</p>
