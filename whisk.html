text: Like a lot of people, I enjoy cooking and most of my recipes either come from Pinterest or All Recipes. I also have a bunch of recipes in my grandma's old cookbook and I find it hard to find things in there. I'm also interested in healthy cooking and I wish I could find more inspiration from what other people make, all in one place. Having these problems in mind I created Whisk. In Whisk you can enter recipes manually or import them from a website. You can create a profile and get inspired by other people's food and create a shopping list <br><!-- a class="link-hover" href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/6qqhblv1waf5t5b/AAArIg9gt0zxcYoqgK-o1gdya?dl=0">UI Walkthrough</a> -->
