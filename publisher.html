text: <h3>CONCEPT</h3><br><p>Publisher is a messaging feature for the Hireloop (homepage) on web and mobile applications where we allow our users to share content or update with a selected group of people in their company.</p><br><p>We use @mention to mention colleagues and &#35;tagging to bring up a candidate or job. @­mention and &#35;­tagging prompt autocompletes when the user uses them and starts typing a name/job title.</p><br><h3>RESEARCH</h3><br><p>This is my first android application, so before starting to wireframe I decided to do a pattern study from different applications that were solving  similar problems such as Facebook, Twitter, Path, Yammer and Google+. Once I got the patterns, I started to draw my initial user flow along with paper wireframes.</p><br><h3>WIREFRAMES AND USER TESTING</h3><br><p>I created two versions of wireframes then I put them together in Marvel. I did user testing with my co-­workers that were android users to make sure the patterns and the flow were clear.</p><br><h3>CHALLENGES</h3><br><p>At first, in my prototype I didn't have # or @ buttons. We don't have those on desktop and I so I felt it would be more consistent and still a great experience without them. However, the senior designers on the team felt strongly that we include them, so I added them.</p><br><p>The visual design took me some time as I got used to the Android platform. I made sure I had feedback from the developer on a regular basis. It was a great opportunity to learn a new platform.</p><br><h3>OUTCOME</h3><br><p>This feature is currently under development and will be released in May. The Hiring app can be found in Google Play.</p>
