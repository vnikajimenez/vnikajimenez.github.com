text: <h3>Concept:</h3><br><p>Hireloop Post is a messaging feature for the Hireloop (home screen) on web and mobile applications where we allow our users to share content or updates with a selected group of people in their company.</p><br><p>We use @mention to mention colleagues and &#35;tagging to bring up a candidate or job. @足mention and &#35;足tagging prompt autocompletes when the user uses them and starts typing a name/job title.</p><br><h3>Research:</h3><br><p>This project was my first time designing for an Android application, so before starting to wireframe I decided to do a pattern study from different applications that were solving similar problems such as Facebook, Twitter, Path, Yammer and Google+. Once I got the patterns, I started to draw my initial user flow along with paper wireframes.</p><br><h3>Wireframes & 足User Testing:</h3><br><p>I created two versions of wireframes then I put them together in Marvel. I did user testing with my co-足workers that were Android users to make sure the patterns and the flow were clear.</p><br><h3>Challenges:</h3><br><p>At first, in my prototype I didn't have &#35; or &#64; buttons. We don't have those on desktop and I so I felt it would be more consistent and still a great experience without them. However, the senior designers on the team felt strongly that we include them, so I added them.</p><br><p>The visual design took me some time as I got used to the Android platform. I made sure I had feedback from the developer on a regular basis. It was a great opportunity to learn a new platform.</p><br><h3>Outcome:</h3><br><p>This feature is currently under development and will be released in May. The Hiring app can be found in Google Play.</p>
