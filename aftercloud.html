title: Aftercloud
text: Aftercloud is an application that allows you to pull memories from social media profiles of a deceased relative or loved one.<br> I took an existing logo they had and softened it, switching the typeface to Avenir, which I find warm and simple.<br>I then worked with the CEO on the signup process. We sketched out some possible flows and eventually came to a three step process. I took it from wireframes to the fleshed out visual design you see below.<br>Finally, I created the main profile view for the deceased. I went for a content focused design. The posts and images take priority while the minimal amount of controls are subtle.<br><br><a class="link-hover" href="http://www.aftercloud.co/">Aftercloud's page</a>
