title: Aftercloud
text: Aftercloud is a start up helps you shut down and save social media profiles when a family member or friend passes away. The main vision is to keep stories alive. The first thing I did was work on their logo. I polished their previous cloud logo with one with more round edges and a warm but simple typeface, Avenir. I also created simple sign up process experience. For the dashboard I focused on content first design where pictures and posts are the focus. The plan was to have an algorithm that chose pictures based on likes to be larger and towards the top of the page. I also wanted to give the option of being able to write memories or thoughts related to the departed.<br><a class="link-hover" href="http://www.aftercloud.co/">Aftercloud's page</a>
