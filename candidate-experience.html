title: Candidate Experience
text: <p><b>CONCEPT:</b></p><br><p>My application helps a job seeker track, manage and get updated on the status of  their application within a specific company. In this case we started with the customers of SR.</p><br><p>Job seeking is a stressful matter. For most of us, when we send an application to most companies, it is like entering a black hole where we don’t have any idea what is going to happen next. After the product manager on the team and I did some user research,we concluded that most the time people feel anxious, frustrated and worried when looking for a job,and that they find the hiring process lengthy, unclear, and lacking in feedback.</p><br><p>With this in our minds, we defined our project by the problem I don’t have visibility into what happens with my job application after I’ve sent it.</p><br><br><p>SOLUTION:</p><br><p>After we got the requirements made by the PM, another designer and I Started to work on the main touch points that the candidate would have to go through, and what kind of information is valuable from a user standpoint. After whiteboarding we concluded that if the candidate has to go through phone screening, on­site interview and an offer within a company, this information should be displayed in a form of a timeline where candidate can view the status of the application, get updates, communicate with the hiring team, accept interviews and receive the offer letter. This being said, new updates will be displayed in the beginning of the page along with timestamps.</<br>We also added a place where the user can view multiple applications with different companies, all displayed in a simple list view.<br><br>We also wanted to create a more personal experience, by e customizing a company’s looks, adding the company’s logo and colors, and  using friendly language.<br><br>TESTING IDEAS & FEEDBACK:<br><br>We finished the first version of wireframes and we tested a couple of hypothesis about the experience of being taken from the job success message into the application. We found that overall feeling of people being able to see the job status and being able to communicate with hiring team.<br><br>We also found a couple of discoverability issues such as displaying two positions at the same company that we kept working on.<br><br>CHALLENGES:<br><br>At this point in the project, my design partner left and I took care of the rest of the User Experience,visual design any other project issues would be arising afterwards.<br><br>When a candidate applies to two or more positions with thing a company, there would be different messages from different hiring teams. I decided that the way it could work with the design would be to attach the job application with the message from that hiring team, like this overtime you get a new message you would know to which position is related.<br><br>Another challenge was to be clear that when you are applying for more positions you will be considered for the first and that once this one is reviewed you will be considered for the next one, this is the current way companies do it in SR.<br><br>OUTCOME<br><br> The following screens you see below. This application is currently under development and will be released in June.<br>
