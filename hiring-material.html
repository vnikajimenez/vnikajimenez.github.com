text: <h3>CONCEPT</h3><br><p>Last year, Google showcased Material Design for the first time. Material design guides you in creating interfaces that behave like objects in real life where light, movement and form gives better affordances and a very rich interaction experience. This is one of the main reasons why I decided to explore converting SmartRecruiters Hiring Android app into Material.</p><br><h3>START</h3><br><p>First I created a flow map of each screen along with what actions connected them to each other. This helped me to have a clear idea of the product from high level hierarchy to low level interactions.</p><br><h3>CANDIDATE PAGE</h3><br><p>I decided to design the Candidate page of our application first because it is SmartRecruiter's most used feature on mobile.</p><br><p>The existing design has an iOS feeling background and icons. I switched the background to a solid color from the current avatar colors we have in our style sheet. I made sure all icons matched the current Android guidelines.</p><br><p>The info icon interaction in the current design opened a drawer menu. I found this to feel too heavy for the small amount of information being accessed. Instead I used an overflow dialog to make the information more quickly accessible.</p><br><p>I also added the floating action button that transforms into a toolbar upon press or scroll. I added the share ability to the toolbar, which is part of our new HireLoop feature being added soon.</p><br><h3>JOBS PAGE</h3><br><p>The first thing I did with this section was unify the header between the listing and details section. The original design felt inconsistent while navigating around. On the job details page, I felt the "Posted", "Sourcing", "Days Open" and "Spent" indicators looked tappable, which they are not, so I made sure to avoid that in the new design.</p><br><p>In the original design, clicking on the share icon at the top right brought you to a "Referrals" section of the product, where users can share the job url to other contacts in Facebook and LinkedIn. I found users got confused as to where they were taken when they ended up there. Instead I added a floating share button which gives you the option to share the candidate with referrals, or our new HireLoop. I felt this would help the user better understand when they are brought to the referral section.</p><br><h3>Status</h3><br><p>This is still a work in progress. It is currently being reviewed by the rest of our design team and then will be queued up to be worked on.</p>
