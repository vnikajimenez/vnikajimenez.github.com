text: <h3>CONCEPT</h3><br><p>Guardian is an iOS application that helps you to be safe when walking alone. With Guardian you enter your destination and it will create a route where your emergency contacts will be notified through SMS in case of real danger.</p><br><p>I was approached by one of the developers of Guardian, and he showed me an initial version of the app, which was called “Guardian Angel” at the time. Even though the UI was simple, the experience needed to be improved.<br>I started by mapping out the current app in order to identify the main touch points with the user. Then I moved on to create low fidelity paper wireframes, which allowed me to quickly try some different flows and UI. Finally I moved onto Sketch and created medium fidelity mockups which I added to Marvel for user testing.</p><br><br><h3>USER ONBOARDING</h3><br><a href="https://marvelapp.com/8ggbb6">Link to onboarding prototype</a><br><br><p>The app does not require an authenticated account, so I created a simple onboarding experience to get our user's name and phone number. Guardian requires quite a few iOS permissions such as push notifications, access to contacts, ability to run in the background and access to the user's current location. I decided to use the need for asking for these permissions as an opportunity to explain the app's main features using fun copy and animations.</p><br><br><h3>MAP EXPERIENCE</h3><br><a href="https://marvelapp.com/project/461581/">Link to map experience</a><br><br><p>Guardian’s primary feature is a map where you enter a destination. This will create a route with GPS checkpoints. If you start to get off your route, the route line will change from green to yellow to red, before finally opening a timer dialog which will message your emergency contacts if you do not interrupt it. The color change helps the user understand the state of the app. The lifesaver button works as a panic button, which will immediately bring up the timer and give options<br> to call for help.</p>
 <br><h3>USER TESTING</h3><br><p>I used my Marvel prototype of the app to do in person user testing with a few potential users of the app. I tested both the onboarding flow, and the map experience. Below is an outline of the questions I went over during the test.</p><p><br>Onboarding:<br>A) Do you understand what this app is for? <br>B) How do you think it will protect you?<br> C) Who would you add as a Guardian? (I was curious how many they'd want to add)</p><br><p>Map Experience:<br>Let’s pretend you are walking home after school and you want to use the app to enter your home address and start walking.<br>A) How would you do that?<br> B) What do you think the lifesaver icon means?<br>C) Let's pretend someone has been following you, What would you do?</p><br><p>Now that you have the timer alert:<br> A) What do you think will happen when the counter gets to 0?<br>B) What do you think will happen if you tap on “Alert Guardians”?<br> C) Where do you usually hold your device when you’re walking?</p><br><br><h3>TIMER ALERT</h3><br><p>When the app thinks the user may be in danger, a dialog appears with a 45s timer. The user must confirm their safety before the timer reaches 0, otherwise their current location will be shared with their emergency contacts. Since this UI is used at such a potentially critical time, it was very important to get it right.<br>One challenge was making sure users actually noticed if the timer was on if the phone was in their pocket. We tried multiple iterations using combinations of vibration and push notifications. In the end we found that using only vibration was the most noticeable for the user without it being annoying or feeling "spammy".</p><br><br><h3>BRANDING</h3><br><p>I wanted the brand to be warm and make you feel safe. I knew the user could be a wide range of ages and sexes and so I wanted the app to be neutral, but still warm and playful. I changed the name from "Guardian Angel" to "Guardian", as I felt "Guardian Angel" has such strong imagery attached to it that did not work with the brand I imagined.<br> The the lifesaver imagery was easily understood and could be used as an icon within the app. <br>I created the happy illustrations to reinforce the playful aspect, as well as add something unique.</p>
 <br><br><h3>THINGS I LEARNED</h3><br><p>This was my first experience taking an entire application from wireframes to user testing to final visual design. It was nice that the app was simple as it allowed me to focus on doing each of those steps without feeling overwhelmed about <br>the complexity. <br>It was very fun to get to do illustration and motion design work on top of the visual identity I had completely created.</p>
